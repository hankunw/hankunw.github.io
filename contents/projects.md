GNN-Encoder Image Captioning Model: [[Code]](https://github.com/Haokfu/GNN-Encoder-Image-Captioning) \
Innovatively take usage of GNN Embedding layer in Image captioning encoder. Through comparative experiments, three models (as shown below) are trained and evaluated on Flicker8k dataset.
- Vision Transformer（ViT）Encoder Captioning Model
- Graph Convolutional Network（GCN）Encoder Captioning Model
- Graph Attention Network（GAT）Encoder Captioning Model
- Eventually test generalization ability of three models on COCO dataset


3d-viewer: [[Code]](https://github.com/Haokfu/3d-viewer) \
Developed an interactive 3D scene reconstruction viewer to simplify the 3D asset editing process and improve rendering efficiency. The main work includes: 
- Code Migration：Migrate the Pytorch-based 3D reconstruction technology (PAPR, Proximity Attention Point Rendering) from the original framework to Nerfstudio codebase. 
- Model Optimization：Identify rendering performance bottlenecks through benchmarking and design optimization solutions to improve real-time rendering speed


MyRuns: [[Code]](https://github.com/Haokfu/MyRuns) \
Developed an app that records users' motion mode, calories, and heart rate. The main work includes: 
- Apply Google Map Api in the application to record motion track of users. 
- In automatic mode, the app automatically detects the user's activity type. Using Weka to perform automatic motion mode classification. 
- User motion record can be recorded in the history tab 


AI Chatbot Character: [[Code]](https://github.com/lnthorne/Character-Chatbot-Application) [[Download]](https://sites.google.com/view/362-group-22-project-webpage/home) \
Participates in an Android App development. The app can let user create their own chatbot character and chat with the character by their preference. The main feature includes: 
- Create Your AI: Users can build their unique AI character by providing brief descriptions (prompts).
- Engage in Conversation: Have meaningful and personalized conversations with your AI character.
- Prompt History: Access and modify your history of prompts to refine your character or steer the conversation in new directions.
- Character Customization: During onboarding, design your singular AI character by submitting descriptive prompts. You can continuously evolve your AI companion by modifying these prompts.
